# HW-Challenge-12-Employee-Tracker

## Description

Our objective this assignment was to add code to make the note taker code given to us functional.

Main Objectives: 

- When I open the Note Taker, I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
- When I click on the link to the notes page, I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the    note’s text in the right-hand column
- When I enter a new note title and the note’s text, a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
- When I click on the Save icon, the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
- When I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, that note appears in the right-hand column
- When I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page, I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
